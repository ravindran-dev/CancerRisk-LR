# CancerRisk - Logistic Regression

This project implements **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental algorithm in statistical learning, to perform binary classification on a real-world dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and result visualization.

## Project Highlights

- End-to-end binary classification pipeline
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC)
- Confusion matrix and performance visualization

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression-project.git](https://github.com/RAVINDRAN-S/Cancer_Prediction---Logistic-Regression)
cd logistic-regression-project
```
2. Set Up the Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash

jupyter notebook
```
Then open Logistic Regression Project.ipynb and run the cells.
